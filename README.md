#This is my Habit Counter App project 

This is a requirement to pass the course Object Oriented Programming in Python

#What is it?

The Habit tracker app uses the CLI in Python to add, track and analyze habits that a user wants to improve upon.
This app has a more gamified approach as an additional feature for the user. A points-based leveling up system is created to help motivate the user to track their habits within the application. The analysis measures consistency of habits "checked off" on the daily and weekly basis.
